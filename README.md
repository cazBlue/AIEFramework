AIEFramework
============
==== updated 14/8/2015 for VS2013 to remove glew dependacnies in place of GL core 4_4 ====

The AIE C++ OpenGL Framework, used by Advanced Diploma and Degree students. This repo is in constant flux and improvement. Differences may exist between this code-base and class tutorials.

Purpose:

  - A cross-platform (Windows, OSX, Linux) wrapper for a real-time OpenGL game loop.
  - OpenGL functionality should remain bare for students to learn as much as possible.
  - The ability to load textures and 3D models will be provided, but loaded model data will
    not automatically create OpenGL resources.
  - A helper class for easily drawing debug 2D/3D "widgets" will be provided so that basic 
    math ideas can be demonstrated, along with A.I. entities and physics, without the need to 
    load a model.

Dependencies:

  This project depends on the following 3rd-party libraries:

  - OpenGl core using OpenGL Loader Generator - version 4_4
  - GLFW (for managing basic OpenGL window and controls)
  - GLM (for mathematics) - apply scalar fix from https://github.com/g-truc/glm/issues/325
  - STB (for simple image loading) 
  - FBX SDK 2015.1 (for the optional FBXLoader library for loading FBX models)
 
Setup:

  - Pull the entire repo to your local machine.
  - Use cmake on the GLFW dependency and build it in debug and release. (updated to include relevant libs for VS2013)
  - Install the FBX SDK 2015.1 (VS2013 edition if using VS2013).
  - You may need to tweak the environment variable for the FBX SDK directory.

Visual Studio Project Template:

  Within the /tools/ folder there are zip files that contain project templates for Visual Studio 2012/13.
  
  These should be placed within the Visual Studio folder located within your user Documents folder.
  
  i.e. for Visual Studio 2013 on a typical install:
    C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C++ Project\
    
  With the project templates you are able to add a new pre-made project to the AIE framework by simply opening the AIE solution and selecting "Add Project" and choosing the AIEApplication project type.
